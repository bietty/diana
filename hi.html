        Diney shikor, I love you so much that I can't even describe it. You are
        the light at my darkness and I always thank God to have you as my
        bestfriend. You don't only have white skined face but you also have the
        whitest and purest heart. You have so many qualities that I can't even
        list them all. You are rare as blue diamond to the world. I hope and
        wish you to have the best things the world can offer including
        happiness, cuz you deserve to be happy all the time. I feel bad to not
        be with you to celebrate your sepcial day this year, but I really hope
        you will have the happiest birthday my dear. I Love you!
